# DailyTaskMangerApp
The Daily Task Planner is a C# console application that allows users to add and view their daily tasks for each day of the week. Users can easily organize and manage their tasks by selecting a specific day and adding tasks with their corresponding time.

Features:
Add tasks for each day of the week, from Monday to Friday.
Tasks added for Wednesdays are automatically marked as "Assessment day" for the rest of the day.
Users can view their tasks for any chosen day of the week.
The application does not allow adding tasks for Saturdays and Sundays, as they are designated as "No Daily Task" days.
